This is a sample for a challenge. Lorum ipsum dolor sit amet and other words. The proper word for a layout like this would be typesetting, or so I would imagine, but for now let's carry on calling it an example piece of text. Hold up - the end of the paragraph is approaching - notice the double line break for a paragraph. And so begins the start of the second paragraph but as you can see it's only marginally better than the other one so you've not really gained much - sorry. I am certainly not a budding author as you can see from this example input. Perhaps I need to work on my writing skills.")

However, one other rather more interesting number is two hundred and twenty-one quadrillion, eight hundred and six trillion, four hundred and thirty-four billion, five hundred and thirty-seven milmillion, nine hundred and seventy-eight thousand, six hundred and seventy nine, which isn't prime but is the 83rd Lucas number.")
